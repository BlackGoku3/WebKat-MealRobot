# Food Cutting Robots

This project deals with the problem of teaching robots how to execute unknown tasks in the household domain using web knowledge. 
The current focus lies on the task of *Cutting Food*, especially fruits and vegetables.
This website provides an extensive documentation of the approach and its different aspects.

This website covers the [architecture](https://food-ninja.github.io/FoodCutting/Architecture.html) of the system we use for our approach as well as describing the required [web knowledge](https://food-ninja.github.io/FoodCutting/Knowledge.html).
We explain the different ways of [querying our knowledge graph](https://food-ninja.github.io/FoodCutting/OntologyQuery.html) as well as providing a [webinterface](https://food-ninja.github.io/FoodCutting/Webinterface.html) to demonstrate the possible results for all action-food combinations available in our KG.
To assess the practical application of our approach, we performed an [experiment](https://food-ninja.github.io/FoodCutting/Experiment.html). Videos of the experiment are also available [here](https://food-ninja.github.io/FoodCutting/Videos.html).
