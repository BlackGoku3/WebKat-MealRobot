        Challenge: We want to enable robots to learn everyday manipulation tasks from the Web and thus make abstract knowledge <i>actionable</i>.
		This challenge is important for robots that can perform a wide breadth of manipulation tasks and task variations, that can be performed by various robots using various tools for a variety of purposes.
        For a robot to successfully perform such a breadth of maniulation actions, it needs to <b>understand</b> given tasks. We start tackling this challenge by focusing on selected task domains, starting with cutting.

  </div>
</div>

 The idea is that our methodology can teach robots to cut any fruit with any to for any purpose, as visualised on top. For this, the robot needs to query the knowledge graph to parameterise its general action plan.
