For a robot to successfully perform such a breadth of maniulation actions, it needs to understand given tasks. On this website we show how robots can use a knowledge graph to understand a given task by answering questions such as

"What is the result state when performing a specific action?"
"What object can be used to perform a given task?" "Is there a preferred object to use for this task?"
"Can the task be performed on a given object?" etc.
